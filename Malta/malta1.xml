La distanza sempre piu evidente dallalbergatore e insieme il supporto di Leo la spingono a prendere una decisione drastica nella speranza di mettere un punto a questa storia. Elena e preoccupata per la transizione di Dani e, anche sarebbe piu semplice parlare delle sue paure direttamente a suo figlio, cerca di informarsi per conto suo, ma questa si rivela una pessima idea. A Rio Muni gli ultimi episodi avvenuti in carcere con Victor fanno in modo che Carmen, stanca degli stratagemmi di Patricia, provi finalmente a ribaltare la situazione.

Thankfully, not every patient has a tendency to fall in love with Paul, as there are those who are already in loving relationships elsewhere. One such person is Kelli, who comes to the doctors for help with her upturned nose, the result of a botched operation. Kelli is engaged to be married and wants her nose to be fixed before any wedding photos are taken, so Paul does what he can to make her picture-perfect. While he helps Kelli, Terry works with Kristina, a mother of four who suffered complications after a tummy tuck operation went wrong.

Quella del Possedimento italiano del Dodecaneso è una storia controversa che, pur contemplando una vasta opera di ammodernamento economico e urbanistico, reca in se le caratteristiche di un vero e proprio dominio coloniale. Il regime fascista, soprattutto durante il Governatorato di Cesare Maria De Vecchi, attua una politica di assimilazione linguistica e culturale forzata alimentando nei dodecanesini profondi sentimenti antitaliani. Dopo larmistizio, nel settembre del 1943, alloccupazione italiana subentra quella, ancora più feroce, delle truppe tedesche, e alla fine del Secondo conflitto mondiale, col Trattato di Parigi siglato il 10 febbraio del 1947 tra lItalia e le potenze vincitrici, le isole egee vengono assegnate definitivamente alla Grecia.

Le città sono devastate dai bombardamenti, le infrastrutture paralizzate, la popolazione è stremata dalla fame e dalla miseria. La ricostruzione ha inizio tra mille difficoltà: mancano alloggi e beni essenziali, linflazione è alle stelle, la disoccupazione è dilagante, la borsa nera prospera e i reduci fanno ritorno in un Paese profondamente cambiato. Eppure, è proprio tra le macerie che prende il via una delle trasformazioni più straordinarie della storia dellItalia contemporanea. È il Piano Marshall a dare un primo impulso alla ripresa economica, ma è soprattutto la voglia degli italiani di lasciarsi definitivamente alle spalle gli orrori della guerra a spingere il Paese verso un nuovo inizio. Nascono il Piano Sinigaglia e il Piano INA-Casa, che rilanciano la siderurgia e ledilizia, creando lavoro e nuove abitazioni. Tuttavia, lo sviluppo economico porta con se nuove tensioni: nelle città come nelle campagne, esplodono i conflitti sociali. Il processo di modernizzazione, però, non si arresta. Industria, energia e trasporti diventano i motori del cambiamento.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.0.</episode-num></programme>

Eppure, è proprio tra le macerie che prende il via una delle trasformazioni più straordinarie della storia dellItalia contemporanea. È il Piano Marshall a dare un primo impulso alla ripresa economica, ma è soprattutto la voglia degli italiani di lasciarsi definitivamente alle spalle gli orrori della guerra a spingere il Paese verso un nuovo inizio. Nascono il Piano Sinigaglia e il Piano INA-Casa, che rilanciano la siderurgia e ledilizia, creando lavoro e nuove abitazioni. Tuttavia, lo sviluppo economico porta con se nuove tensioni: nelle città come nelle campagne, esplodono i conflitti sociali. Il processo di modernizzazione, però, non si arresta. Industria, energia e trasporti diventano i motori del cambiamento.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.0.</episode-num></programme>

Il ritorno</sub-title><desc>Dopo dieci anni di vagabondaggio in mare, Ulisse ritrova la sua famiglia e il suo regno. Si conclude qui anche il viaggio nellOdissea di "5000 anni e più. La lunga storia dellumanità". Gli ultimi 12 libri dellOdissea descrivono ciò che accadde quando Ulisse fa finalmente ritorno ad Itaca, ritrovando i suoi cari, e la sanguinosa vendetta che egli compie per riconquistare il suo trono. Omero racconta una storia complessa di tradimento, lealtà, astuzia e forza: una folla di giovani ha invaso il palazzo reale, saccheggiato i suoi magazzini e corteggiato la sua regina, Penelope, nel tentativo di impadronirsi della corona. Ma lastuzia con cui Penelope resiste ai pretendenti durante lassenza di Ulisse rivela non solo la sua incrollabile lealtà, ma anche il suo ruolo centrale nellintera narrazione. Ad introdurre la puntata con Giorgio Zanchini in studio, Massimo Cultraro, docente di Preistoria e Archeologia Egea allUniversità di Palermo.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2022..</episode-num></programme>

Ma anche il racconto di storie che rivelano la profonda conoscenza di Omero dei fenomeni del mare e della pratica della navigazione, tanto da essere acclamato da molti come il padre delloceanografia. Tematiche approfondite in questa puntata. Se lOdissea è il primo vero trattato sul mare della storia, è stata anche il precursore di generazioni di romanzi di mare, ricchi di avventura e di resoconti di viaggi in luoghi sconosciuti. Ha introdotto larchetipo universale del "nostos", una parola greca che significa il ritorno a casa delleroe.

Il ritorno</sub-title><desc>Dopo dieci anni di vagabondaggio in mare, Ulisse ritrova la sua famiglia e il suo regno. Si conclude qui anche il viaggio nellOdissea di "5000 anni e più. La lunga storia dellumanità". Gli ultimi 12 libri dellOdissea descrivono ciò che accadde quando Ulisse fa finalmente ritorno ad Itaca, ritrovando i suoi cari, e la sanguinosa vendetta che egli compie per riconquistare il suo trono. Omero racconta una storia complessa di tradimento, lealtà, astuzia e forza: una folla di giovani ha invaso il palazzo reale, saccheggiato i suoi magazzini e corteggiato la sua regina, Penelope, nel tentativo di impadronirsi della corona. Ma lastuzia con cui Penelope resiste ai pretendenti durante lassenza di Ulisse rivela non solo la sua incrollabile lealtà, ma anche il suo ruolo centrale nellintera narrazione. Ad introdurre la puntata con Giorgio Zanchini in studio, Massimo Cultraro, docente di Preistoria e Archeologia Egea allUniversità di Palermo.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2022..</episode-num></programme>

È necessario, per la salvaguardia della vita, creare il tabù della guerra. Come da sempre esistono altri tabù, che ci difendono dal caos e dallautodistruzione, si potrebbe instaurare tra gli uomini questa nuova convenzione sociale."

Il pugile diventa il campione spavaldo e istrionico che il mondo impara a conoscere. Con ladesione alla religione islamica Clay cambia il suo nome in Muhammad Ali e si avvicina alle posizioni della Nation of Islam, trasformandosi presto in un simbolo delle battaglie per lemancipazione del popolo afroamericano. Nel 1967 si rifiuta di andare a combattere in Vietnam per motivi religiosi. La scelta gli costa il titolo mondiale e lallontanamento dalla boxe. Solo negli anni 70 può tornare sul ring. Nel 1974 affronta a Kinshasa, capitale dello Zaire, il detentore del titolo, George Foreman. Lincontro acquista subito un sapore mitico e catalizza linteresse del mondo intero.

Ma esiste anche un lato meno noto della sua persona: la sua indole ribelle, refrattaria alle grettezze del potere, il suo coraggioso impegno per gli indios dellAmazzonia, la sua penna di scrittore di romanzi per ragazzi, tradotti in tutto il mondo, come Orzowei.
