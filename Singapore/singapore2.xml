Years have passed since Yoke and Ella had their lives turned upside-down when they returned to be with their rightful families after having been swapped at birth. Years later, Yoke has seemingly embraced her role as a status-conscious, high society Shelley, assuming a leadership role in the family business. Ella has accepted her fate as a member of the salt of the earth, working-class Loh family but struggles to make something of her life. Has the nature vs nurture battle run its course or are relationships between the families still as fraught and complicated as ever? The Lohs, Shelleys, Hassans, and Balas have overcome personal loss, incarceration, as well as estrangement of their loved ones; yet lingering tensions remain. Mysteries continue to unfold as characters pursue their individual agendas, while emotional drama abounds as surprising twists are revealed that threaten the stability to which they have become accustomed..</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.210.</episode-num></programme>

Some of these keepsakes have already found their way into the National Collection, leading the hosts to the Heritage Conservation Centre to see how theyre carefully preserved. Others remain tucked away in storerooms and cupboards—objects that may look ordinary, but carry extraordinary tales. Each find comes with its own story—sometimes funny, sometimes moving, always personal. And in true roving-museum style, photos of these special items are taken and printed right there in the van, catalogued on the spot as living pieces of history. As the van fills up with stories and snapshots, so too does an ever-growing archive of memories— some of which will go on to inspire displays in a pop-up museum at the National Museum of Singapore.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.18.</episode-num></programme>
