Charli has been invited to a party but is feeling a bit nervous about going. Tinks loves helping Charli feel confident. She wants to help Charli feel good about herself so she can go and have fun at the party. Tinks fetches Charlis hair brush so Charli can brush her newly-dyed pink hair, and then helps Charli choose a party outfit.

Tinks is determined to help Charli get to the party, even in the rain. But how? She summons all her big dog energy and sets off in search of a plan.
